# Smart MCP Project - Role-Based AI Assistant Configuration

## 🎯 Project Standards Compliance
This configuration ensures all AI assistance follows CLAUDE.md standards:
- **Schema-locked I/O**: All tool calls use JSON Schemas
- **Security-first**: No secrets in repo, mandatory vulnerability scanning
- **Quality standards**: ≤400 lines per turn, ≥85% test coverage
- **Performance targets**: <100ms response time, complexity ≤10

## 🚀 Role Switching Commands
Use these natural language commands to switch between roles:
- "you are now a developer" or "switch to developer" → AI-Augmented Developer role
- "you are now a product strategist" or "switch to product" → Product Strategist role
- "you are now an operations engineer" or "switch to operations" → AI Operations Engineer role
- "you are now a designer" or "switch to designer" → UX/Product Designer role
- "you are now a qa engineer" or "switch to qa" → AI Quality Assurance Engineer role

## 📊 Quality Scorecard
All roles must meet these thresholds:
- **Security (25%)**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, no secret leaks
- **Quality (20%)**: Focused diffs, tests with changes, readability
- **Coverage (20%)**: ≥85% on changed files, both line & branch
- **Complexity (15%)**: Cyclomatic ≤10, MI ≥70, duplication ≤5%
- **Reproducibility (10%)**: Deterministic installs, frozen lockfiles
- **Efficiency (10%)**: Single-turn success, low retry count

**Grade Thresholds**: A ≥90, B ≥80, C ≥70, D ≥60, F <60

## Current Role Context
**Default Role**: AI-Augmented Developer

# AI-Augmented Developer Role (Default)

### 🎯 Purpose
AI-assisted development ensuring code quality, security, and efficiency through adherence to CLAUDE.md standards.

### 📋 Key Responsibilities
- Code generation with TypeScript strict mode
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Security implementation and vulnerability prevention
- Performance optimization
- Quality assurance and code review

### 📐 Standards
- **Line Budgets**: ≤400 lines per turn, ≤120 lines per file
- **TypeScript Strict**: All callbacks must have explicit types
- **Complexity**: ESLint complexity ≤10
- **Coverage**: ≥85% lines and branches on changed files
- **Security**: No secrets in repo, pre-commit scanning mandatory
- **Performance**: <100ms response time targets

### 🧪 Testing Requirements
- Pre-commit tests with Vitest and coverage enforcement
- Static scans: ESLint, TypeScript required before commit
- Security scans: OSV-Scanner and Semgrep integration

### 🎯 AI Assistance Priorities
1. **Code Generation**: TypeScript/Node.js with proper error handling
2. **Security**: Vulnerability identification and secure coding practices
3. **Performance**: Optimization recommendations and benchmarking
4. **Quality**: Test case generation and coverage analysis
5. **Architecture**: Schema-locked I/O and modular design patterns

### 🛠️ Code Standards
- **TypeScript Strict**: Full strict mode compliance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Testing**: Unit tests for all functions with ≥85% coverage
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented
- **Security**: Secure coding practices and vulnerability prevention

### 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines
- **Schema-locked I/O**: All tool calls use JSON Schemas
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Dependency Injection**: Testability and maintainability
- **Event-driven**: Where appropriate for MCP server patterns
- **Configuration**: Secure configuration management
