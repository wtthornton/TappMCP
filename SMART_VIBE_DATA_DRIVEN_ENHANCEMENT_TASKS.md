## 📝 Smart Vibe Sub-task Creation Instructions

### How to Create Sub-tasks
When working on a task, Smart Vibe should:

1. **Analyze the task complexity** - If estimated time > 3 days, break into sub-tasks
2. **Identify dependencies** - Mark which sub-tasks depend on others
3. **Create specific sub-tasks** - Each sub-task should be 1-2 days of work
4. **Add acceptance criteria** - Each sub-task needs clear success criteria
5. **Update the main task** - Mark sub-tasks as created in the main task
6. **Track progress** - Update sub-task status as work progresses

### Sub-task Template
```markdown
- [ ] **Sub-task X.Y.Z**: [Sub-task name]
  - **Description**: [Brief description]
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: [Specific success criteria]
  - **Estimated Time**: [1-2 days]
  - **Dependencies**: [List any dependencies]
  - **Status**: [Planned/In Progress/Completed/Blocked]
```

### Task Completion Process
1. **Complete the sub-task** - Finish all work and testing
2. **Validate acceptance criteria** - Ensure all criteria are met
3. **Update status** - Mark sub-task as completed
4. **Check main task** - See if all sub-tasks are complete
5. **Complete main task** - If all sub-tasks done, mark main task complete
6. **Update progress** - Update overall progress tracking
