# Architecture Decisions

**Date**: December 2024
**Status**: Approved for Implementation
**Context**: Smart MCP server architecture and tool design

## 🎯 **Decision Summary**

Smart MCP will implement a **business-focused tool architecture** with core orchestration tools and business-specific tools, centralized business context management, and built-in business value validation pipeline.

## 🏗️ **Tool Architecture: Business-Focused Approach**

### **Core Tools (Business-Agnostic)**
```
Core Tools:
├── smart_orchestrate    # Business Orchestration engine
├── smart_plan           # Business request analysis and planning
├── smart_execute        # Task execution with business context
├── smart_validate       # Business value gates and validation
└── smart_context        # Business context management
```

### **Business-Specific Tools (Optional)**
```
Business-Specific Tools:
├── product_define       # Business requirements and user stories
├── design_create        # UX/UI design with accessibility focus
├── dev_implement        # Code implementation with security focus
├── qa_test              # Quality assurance with cost prevention
└── ops_deploy           # Operations and deployment with business value
```

### **Benefits of Business-Focused Approach**
- ✅ **Core tools** handle business orchestration and common functionality
- ✅ **Business-specific tools** provide specialized business capabilities when needed
- ✅ **Flexibility** to use either approach based on business complexity
- ✅ **Business compatibility** with existing 4-tool structure

## 🎭 **Smart Orchestration Integration**

### **Central Business Orchestration Tool**
```typescript
smart_orchestrate: {
  name: "smart_orchestrate",
  description: "Orchestrate complete SDLC workflows with automatic role switching for business value",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      request: { type: "string", description: "Business request" },
      options: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          skipPhases: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
          focusAreas: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
          timeEstimate: { type: "number" },
          costPrevention: { type: "boolean", description: "Focus on cost prevention" }
        }
      }
    },
    required: ["request"]
  }
}
```

### **Benefits**
- ✅ **Single entry point** for complex business workflows
- ✅ **Automatic role orchestration** with business focus
- ✅ **Business control** through business-focused options
- ✅ **Business context preservation** across role transitions

## 🧠 **Business Context Management Architecture**

### **Centralized Business Context Broker**
```typescript
class BusinessContextBroker {
  private businessContext: Map<string, any> = new Map();
  private roleHistory: RoleTransition[] = [];

  // Methods for business context management
  setBusinessContext(key: string, value: any, role?: string): void
  getBusinessContext(key: string, role?: string): any
  preserveBusinessContext(transition: RoleTransition): void
  getRoleHistory(): RoleTransition[]
  getCostPrevention(): CostPreventionMetrics
}
```

### **Benefits**
- ✅ **Single source of truth** for business context
- ✅ **Role transition tracking** for business debugging
- ✅ **Business context persistence** across tool calls
- ✅ **Business memory management** and cleanup

## 🔍 **Business Value Gates Integration**

### **Built-in Business Value Validation Pipeline**
```typescript
class BusinessValuePipeline {
  validateSecurity(content: any): BusinessValueResult
  validateCoverage(content: any): BusinessValueResult
  validateComplexity(content: any): BusinessValueResult
  validatePerformance(content: any): BusinessValueResult
  validateCostPrevention(content: any): BusinessValueResult
  generateBusinessScorecard(results: BusinessValueResult[]): BusinessScorecard
}
```

### **Integration Points**
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** for security scanning and cost prevention
- ✅ **Tool output validation** against business value standards
- ✅ **Automatic business scorecard generation** (A-F grades)
- ✅ **Business value gate enforcement** before proceeding

## 🎯 **Key Design Decisions**

### **1. Business Tool Granularity**
- **Coarse-grained tools** for business orchestration (smart_orchestrate)
- **Fine-grained tools** for specific business tasks (dev_implement, qa_test)
- **Utility tools** for common business operations (smart_validate, smart_context)

### **2. Business State Management**
- **Stateless tools** for simple business operations
- **Stateful orchestration** for complex business workflows
- **Business context persistence** across role transitions

### **3. Business Error Handling**
- **Graceful degradation** when business tools fail
- **Role-specific error handling** based on business context
- **Recovery mechanisms** for failed business orchestration

### **4. Business Performance**
- **Lazy loading** of business-specific tools
- **Caching** of business context and knowledge
- **Parallel execution** where possible for business value
