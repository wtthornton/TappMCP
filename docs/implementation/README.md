## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Developer Role:
1. **Create detailed task lists** for each role in each phase's `tasks/` folder
2. **Break down user stories** into specific, actionable tasks
3. **Define dependencies** between tasks and phases
4. **Estimate effort** for each task
5. **Create implementation schedules** for each role

### Task List Structure (to be created):
Each phase's `tasks/` folder should contain:
- `developer-tasks.md` - Technical implementation tasks
- `product-strategist-tasks.md` - Business requirements and validation tasks
- `operations-engineer-tasks.md` - Infrastructure and deployment tasks
- `designer-tasks.md` - UX/UI and user experience tasks
- `qa-engineer-tasks.md` - Testing and quality assurance tasks
