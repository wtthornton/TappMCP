## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Lessons Learned - QA Prevention Checklist**

### **Before Any QA Work:**
1. **Environment Check**: Verify all tools are installed and configured
2. **Baseline Assessment**: Run `npm run qa:all` to establish current state
3. **Tool Validation**: Ensure ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Vitest are working
4. **Security Tools**: Verify Gitleaks, OSV-Scanner, Semgrep are functional

### **During QA Testing:**
1. **Incremental Testing**: Test changes as they're made, not at the end
2. **Coverage Monitoring**: Track coverage in real-time, not just at completion
3. **Performance Validation**: Test response times for every change
4. **Security Scanning**: Run security checks on every commit
5. **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality still works

### **Quality Gate Enforcement:**
1. **TypeScript Errors**: 0 tolerance - block all commits with TS errors
2. **ESLint Violations**: 0 tolerance - enforce all rules consistently
3. **Test Failures**: 0 tolerance - all tests must pass
4. **Coverage Drops**: Block commits that reduce coverage below 85%
5. **Performance Regression**: Block commits that increase response time >100ms

### **Common QA Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ **Skipping Pre-commit Checks**: Always run full validation before commit
- ❌ **Ignoring Test Warnings**: Treat all test warnings as potential issues
- ❌ **Coverage Gaps**: Ensure new code has adequate test coverage
- ❌ **Performance Blind Spots**: Test performance impact of all changes
- ❌ **Security Oversights**: Don't skip security scans for "minor" changes
- ❌ **Tool Configuration**: Keep all QA tools updated and properly configured

### **Test File Quality Standards:**
- **Function Size**: ≤150 lines per test function
- **Test Complexity**: ≤15 cyclomatic complexity
- **Test Coverage**: ≥85% for all test files
- **Test Performance**: Individual tests should complete in <1 second
- **Test Reliability**: Tests should be deterministic and not flaky

### **Security Testing Requirements:**
- **Secrets Scanning**: Every commit must be scanned for secrets
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Dependencies must be checked for vulnerabilities
- **SAST Scanning**: Static analysis must pass on all code
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates and vulnerability patching
- **Access Control**: Validate all authentication and authorization

### **Performance Testing Standards:**
- **Response Time**: <100ms for all API endpoints
- **Load Testing**: System must handle expected load + 20% buffer
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor and alert on memory leaks
- **CPU Usage**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Scalability**: System must scale with increased load

### **AI Tool Validation:**
- **Output Quality**: Verify AI-generated code meets standards
