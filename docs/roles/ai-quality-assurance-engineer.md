## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Lessons Learned - QA Prevention Checklist**

### **Before Any QA Work:**
1. **Environment Check**: Verify all tools are installed and configured
2. **Baseline Assessment**: Run `npm run qa:all` to establish current state
3. **Tool Validation**: Ensure ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Vitest are working
4. **Security Tools**: Verify Gitleaks, OSV-Scanner, Semgrep are functional

### **During QA Testing:**
1. **Incremental Testing**: Test changes as they're made, not at the end
2. **Coverage Monitoring**: Track coverage in real-time, not just at completion
3. **Performance Validation**: Test response times for every change
4. **Security Scanning**: Run security checks on every commit
5. **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality still works

### **Quality Gate Enforcement:**
1. **TypeScript Errors**: 0 tolerance - block all commits with TS errors
2. **ESLint Violations**: 0 tolerance - enforce all rules consistently
3. **Test Failures**: 0 tolerance - all tests must pass
4. **Coverage Drops**: Block commits that reduce coverage below 85%
5. **Performance Regression**: Block commits that increase response time >100ms

### **Common QA Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ **Skipping Pre-commit Checks**: Always run full validation before commit
- ❌ **Ignoring Test Warnings**: Treat all test warnings as potential issues
- ❌ **Coverage Gaps**: Ensure new code has adequate test coverage
