## üìê Architectural Standards
Following project-guidelines.md principles:

### Schema-Locked I/O
- All tool calls use JSON Schemas
- Unified diffs only, no full-file rewrites
- Deterministic builds with `npm ci`

### Code Quality Standards
- **Line Budgets**: ‚â§400 lines per turn, ‚â§120 lines per file
- **TypeScript Strict**: `tsc --strict`, `strictNullChecks`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
- **Complexity**: ESLint complexity ‚â§10
- **Coverage**: ‚â•85% lines and branches on changed files

### Security Standards
- **Secrets**: No secrets in repo, pre-commit scanning mandatory
- **SCA**: OSV-Scanner for vulnerability detection
- **SAST**: Semgrep OWASP + LLM agent rules
- **Commit Authenticity**: Signed commits on protected branches

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy
- **Pre-commit Tests**: Vitest on changed files with coverage enforcement
- **Coverage Requirements**: ‚â•85% on changed files, both line & branch
- **Static Scans**: ESLint, tsc required before commit
- **Complexity Checks**: ESLint complexity ‚â§10, duplication ‚â§5%

---

## üìä Success Metrics
Aligned with project-guidelines.md scorecard:

### Security (25% weight)
- **Zero Critical Vulnerabilities**: No new critical/high vulnerabilities

- **Security Score**: A-grade security compliance

### Quality (20% weight)
- **Code Quality**: Focused diffs, tests with changes, readability
- **Line Budgets**: ‚â§400 lines per turn, ‚â§120 lines per file
- **Complexity**: ESLint complexity ‚â§10

### Coverage (20% weight)
- **Test Coverage**: ‚â•85% on changed files, both line & branch
- **Coverage Enforcement**: PRs blocked if coverage <85%

### Complexity (15% weight)
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: ‚â§10
- **Duplication**: ‚â§5%
- **Maintainability**: High readability scores

### Reproducibility (10% weight)
- **Deterministic Builds**: `npm ci` and frozen lockfiles
- **Parity Runs**: Consistent local and CI results

### Efficiency (10% weight)
- **Single-turn Success**: Low retry count, fast execution
- **AI Tool Effectiveness**: Measure AI-assisted productivity gains

**Grade Thresholds**: A ‚â•90, B ‚â•80, C ‚â•70, D ‚â•60, F <60
