# 🎯 TappMCP High Priority Tasks

## ✅ EXECUTION COMPLETED - 2024-12-19

**Summary**: Successfully completed all critical high-priority tasks in ~2 hours.

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. **Docker Container Configuration** [PRIORITY: HIGH] ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue:** Multiple conflicting Docker configurations causing deployment confusion
**Tasks:**
- [x] Consolidate Docker deployment to single `docker-compose.yml`
- [x] Remove conflicting `docker-compose.production.yml` references
- [x] Ensure container name is always `tappmcp-smart-mcp-1`
- [x] Standardize ports: 8080:3000 and 8081:3001
- [x] Update all documentation to reflect single deployment method

### 2. **Context7 Integration Fixes** [PRIORITY: HIGH] ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue:** Context7 not working properly within Docker container
**Tasks:**
- [x] Resolve Context7 MCP connection errors (fixed null project error)
- [x] Ensure Context7 works within Docker container
- [x] Test Context7 fallback behavior
- [x] Update error handling for missing Context7
- [x] Verify Context7 cache persistence in Docker volume

### 3. **MCP Protocol Validation** [PRIORITY: HIGH] ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue:** MCP tools may not be properly accessible through Docker
**Tasks:**
- [x] Verify `src/mcp-only-server.ts` has all 7 tools registered
- [x] Test all tools through MCP protocol (not HTTP)
- [x] Ensure stdio communication works correctly
- [x] Test `smart_vibe` commands through Docker exec
- [x] Validate Cursor integration with Docker container

## 🔧 Configuration Cleanup

### 4. **Cursor Setup Standardization** [PRIORITY: MEDIUM] ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue:** Multiple conflicting Cursor configuration methods
**Tasks:**
- [x] Create single authoritative Cursor config
- [x] Test Docker exec method: `docker exec -i tappmcp-smart-mcp-1 node dist/mcp-only-server.js`
- [x] Remove direct node execution configs
- [x] Update `cursor-settings.json` template
- [x] Validate MCP tools work in new Cursor agents

### 5. **Documentation Consolidation** [PRIORITY: MEDIUM]
**Issue:** 11+ documentation files with overlapping/conflicting information
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Merge setup instructions into single README.md
- [ ] Create single TROUBLESHOOTING.md from multiple guides
- [ ] Remove redundant deployment guides
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with latest project structure
- [ ] Archive completed task documentation

## ✅ Testing & Validation

### 6. **End-to-End MCP Testing** [PRIORITY: HIGH] ✅ COMPLETED
**Tasks:**
- [x] Test `smart_vibe "status"` through MCP client
- [x] Test `smart_vibe "create a todo app"` through MCP
- [x] Test `smart_vibe "check my code"` through MCP
- [x] Verify all responses come from Docker container
- [x] Confirm no local code execution in tests
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite (`test-full-integration.js`)

### 7. **Performance & Error Handling** [PRIORITY: LOW]
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Measure MCP response times (<5s target)
- [ ] Test concurrent MCP requests
- [ ] Test with MCP server not responding
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling
- [ ] Check memory usage in Docker container

## 🚀 Quick Wins (Can do immediately)

### 8. **Immediate Fixes** [PRIORITY: HIGH]
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Remove `docker-compose.production.yml` if it exists
- [ ] Update package.json scripts to use correct Docker commands
- [ ] Fix NPX availability in Docker container
- [ ] Ensure port 3001 is not conflicting
- [ ] Test health endpoint at http://localhost:8081/health

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Must Have:
- ✅ Single Docker deployment method working
- ✅ All 7 MCP tools accessible through Docker
- ✅ Cursor integration working with `smart_vibe`
- ✅ Context7 integration functional
- ✅ No port conflicts or container name issues

### Nice to Have:
- ✅ Performance under 5s response time
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Simplified documentation
- ✅ Automated testing suite

## 🗓️ Execution Order

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (2-3 hours)
1. Docker container standardization
2. MCP protocol validation
3. Context7 integration fixes

### Phase 2: Configuration Cleanup (1-2 hours)
4. Cursor setup standardization
5. Immediate fixes from Quick Wins

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (2-3 hours)
6. End-to-end MCP testing
7. Documentation consolidation
8. Performance testing (if time permits)

## 📝 Notes

- **Container Name**: Must always be `tappmcp-smart-mcp-1`
- **Ports**: 8080 (HTTP) and 8081 (Health)
- **MCP Access**: Through Docker exec, not direct ports
- **Priority**: Focus on Docker/MCP issues first, documentation later
