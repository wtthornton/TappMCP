- **Cost Optimization**: Resource usage tracking and optimization

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. **Template-Based Intelligence** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current State**: Tools use sophisticated template systems rather than true AI intelligence
- **Impact**: Limited adaptability to unique project requirements
- **Evidence**: Test output shows "Template-based" rather than "Intelligent" analysis
- **Recommendation**: Integrate real AI models for dynamic analysis

#### 2. **File Size Management** üîß
**Current State**: Some files exceed the 400-line project standard
- **Large Files Identified**:
  - `ToolChainOptimizer.ts`: 460 lines
  - `smart-write.ts`: 1,088 lines
  - `business-analyzer.ts`: 881 lines
- **Recommendation**: Implement the planned refactoring tasks

#### 3. **Test Coverage Gaps** üìä
**Current State**: 2 failing tests in optimization and orchestration
- **Failing Tests**:
  - `ToolChainOptimizer.test.ts`: Caching functionality
  - `smart-orchestrate.test.ts`: Response time threshold
- **Recommendation**: Fix failing tests and improve edge case coverage
