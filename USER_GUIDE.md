# TappMCP v2.0 - Complete User Guide

**Welcome to TappMCP v2.0!** This comprehensive guide will help you get started with the AI assistant enhancement platform that features Smart Vibe natural language interface, Context7 intelligence for AI assistants, and production-ready deployment.

**Purpose**: TappMCP enhances AI assistants (like Claude, Cursor AI) with Context7 intelligence to provide better code suggestions and domain expertise, not to generate code directly.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation Options

**Option A: Clone and Build (Recommended for Development)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wtthornton/TappMCP.git
cd TappMCP
npm ci
npm run build
```

**Option B: NPM Package**
```bash
npm install -g smart-mcp
```

**Option C: Docker (Production)**
```bash
docker pull wtthornton/smart-mcp:latest
# Or build locally:
docker build -t smart-mcp:latest .
```

### 2. Production Deployment

**Docker Compose (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start production deployment
docker-compose up -d smart-mcp

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:8081/health
curl http://localhost:8081/ready
```

**Manual Docker**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name smart-mcp-prod \
  -p 8080:3000 \
  -p 8081:3001 \
  smart-mcp:latest
```

### 3. Cursor Integration

Add to your Cursor MCP configuration (`~/.cursor/mcp_config.json`):

**Local Development:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smart-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/server.js"],
