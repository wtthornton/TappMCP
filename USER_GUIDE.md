git clone https://github.com/wtthornton/TappMCP.git
cd TappMCP
npm ci
npm run build
```

**Option B: NPM Package**
```bash
npm install -g smart-mcp
```

**Option C: Docker (Production)**
```bash
docker pull wtthornton/smart-mcp:latest
# Or build locally:
docker build -t smart-mcp:latest .
```

### 2. Production Deployment

**Docker Compose (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start production deployment
docker-compose up -d smart-mcp

TappMCP integrates seamlessly with Cursor through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing AI assistants with enhanced intelligence and domain expertise.

### 🚀 Quick Setup (3 Methods)

#### Method 1: Automated PowerShell Setup (Recommended)

Run the automated setup script for Windows:

```bash
# Ensure Docker container is running
docker-compose up -d

# Run the setup script
.\setup-cursor-mcp.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Checks and starts Docker container if needed
- ✅ Backs up existing Cursor settings
- ✅ Configures MCP server connection
- ✅ Tests the connection automatically

#### Method 2: Copy Settings File

Copy the pre-configured settings file:

```bash
# Windows
copy cursor-settings.json "%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\settings.json"

# Or manually copy the contents to:
# C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Cursor\User\settings.json
```

**Then restart Cursor** to activate the MCP server.

#### Method 3: Manual Configuration

Configure manually in Cursor settings:

1. Open Cursor Settings (Ctrl+,)
2. Go to Extensions → MCP
3. Add this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "tappmcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "tappmcp-smart-mcp-1", "node", "dist/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      },
      "stdio": true,
      "description": "TappMCP Smart Vibe - AI-powered development assistant"
    }
  },
  "mcp.enabled": true,
  "mcp.defaultServer": "tappmcp"
}
```

### 🔧 Configuration Options
