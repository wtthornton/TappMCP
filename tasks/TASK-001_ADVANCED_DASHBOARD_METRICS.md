## 📊 Metrics Implementation Plan

### High Priority Metrics (Critical System Health)
- [ ] Memory Usage (Heap used/total, RSS, external)
- [ ] CPU Usage (Current utilization percentage)
- [ ] Response Time (Average API response time)
- [ ] Active Connections (WebSocket client count)
- [ ] Success Rate (Request success percentage)
- [ ] Error Rate (Current error rate)

### Medium-High Priority Metrics (Performance)
- [ ] Requests Per Second (Current throughput)
- [ ] Bytes Per Second (Data transfer rate)
- [ ] P95 Response Time (95th percentile)
- [ ] P99 Response Time (99th percentile)
- [ ] Cache Hit Rate (Cache efficiency)
- [ ] Queue Size (Pending operations)

### Medium Priority Metrics (AI/Token Metrics)
- [ ] Token Count (Current token usage)
- [ ] Total Tokens Processed (Lifetime count)
- [ ] Hourly Average Tokens (Processing rate)
- [ ] Throughput (Operations per second)
- [ ] Latency (Processing latency)

### Additional Metrics
- [ ] Workflow Metrics (Active, pending, success rate)
- [ ] Notification Channels (Status and availability)
- [ ] System Info (Uptime, version, timestamp)
- [ ] Available Tools (MCP tools count and status)
